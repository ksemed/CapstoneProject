# CapstoneProject

FBX Model was not included into project due to size limit for GitHub. This can be downloaded through the Capstone Folder - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PFS3VPSEXscDdQEMNmgmUcog07QUBNoX

Note - There is a folder labelled "UnusedCScripts". These scripts were used as stepping stones to complete the C scripts outside of that folder. They were not
used in the Project involving the Harvester and the Operating Chair, but they can be looked at as reference.
